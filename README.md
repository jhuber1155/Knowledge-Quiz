# Knowledge-Quiz

## Description

This project was a test of all the skills we have learned so far. It pushed me to my limits when it came to structuring HTML to support the corresponding Javascript. I learned a tremendous amount about how to use and incorporate objects and how to iterate through arrays and arrays within arrays for the logic for my quiz questions. I learned how to link different Javascript pages to their respective HTML pages. I also learned how to incorporate local storage elements into my code buidling, allowing for the cache of user information to be recalled later by the user, allowing for a smoother interface with the user experience.

This project also reinforced the learned skills of the event listener event and the logic which can be placed and used within it. The order of operations when it comes to reading Javascript became critical to get all the components to run correctly and execute the code the way it was meant to be executed.

The countdown clock presented another challenge which allowed me to reinforce my learned skills. The required variables and thought-process to make the code run correctly and stop when it was meant to was a motivating challenge.

The purpose of this quiz was two-fold, one was to reinforce the learned coding skills we were taught in class, and the second has a knock-on effect of allowing a person to review some of the knowledge they learned while in class and test themselves on specific trivia.

## Credits

I would like to credit my Instructor and Teaching Assistant for all the invaluable help they continue to provide me, as well as the students in my UCLA Coding Bootcamp class! I was able, with their guidance and help, in conjunction with the study materials, to put this together after many many hours of work.

Also I used many references and examples from:

w3schools [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

MDN Web Docs [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

These examples and references include but are not limited to:
how to correctly use .setAttribute and .removeAttribute, the hidden and visible classes, how to display an array within an array, how to read data from an object using an array, and many many more.
